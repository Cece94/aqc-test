Here are the main potential performance bottlenecks for displaying large defect maps

Potential Bottlenecks:

Data Volume
Loading thousands of defects in a single request can be slow
Displaying thousands of visual elements (circles, markers) simultaneously
Each element with its own event listeners (hover, click) -> Collision detection for tooltips/hovers

Interactivity
Position calculations for each defect on every frame

Simple Solutions:

Virtualization: only display defects visible in the viewport
Pagination/Lazy loading: load data in segments
Clustering: group nearby defects into a single marker
